# Angularapp

## Sandbox App from Angular 4 front to back course on Udemy by Brad Traversy.

I figured this would be a good thing to push to github as I'm working through the course and their relative projects. This will keep me commited 
To the seeing the project through to completion. 

This is a sandbox application I'm building as I'm working through Brad Traversy's *Angular 4 Fron to Back* Udemy course.
This application will exist as a living reference point from which I'll be able to revist if I'm ever hazy on how something works when developing in Angular 4 and beyond. Here's a list of everything that I've covered so far. 

+ What is Angular 4?
+ Understanding the advantages of using TypeScript and typing in general for Angular development
+ What an oppinionated Framework is, and why that's not a bad thing for some developers. 
+ What a Component is in Angular
    + The 3 Main Files that make up a Component in Angular.
        + TypeScript
        + HTML
        + Stylesheets
+ What Interfaces are in Angular, and why they're important
+ Creating components from the angular CLI
+ Creating components and hooking them up manually. 
+ The constructor, and ngOnInit, how they're different, and how they're similar. 
    + When to use the constructor, and when to use ngOnInit
+ Template functions in angular I've learned about so far:
    + *ngIf
    + *ngFor

I'll be updating this readme as the application development continues periodically. Thanks for stopping by!
